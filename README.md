# CCNA---BGP-Project
Enterprise Network Design using BGP in Cisco Packet Tracer
## Project Overview
This project simulates two companies connected using BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), while internal routing within each company is managed using OSPF.

The network demonstrates real-world enterprise routing design with internal and external routing protocols.

## Network Architecture
The topology includes:
- Two separate company networks
- Internal routing using OSPF
- External routing between companies using BGP
- Multilayer switches
- Department-based VLAN segmentation
- WAN connectivity between organizations

Departments configured:
- IT
- HR
- Accounts
- Sales

## Key Configurations Performed
- Configured OSPF for internal routing within each company
- Configured BGP to connect two different enterprise networks
- Implemented VLANs for department segmentation
- Configured Inter-VLAN routing
- Implemented DHCP for automatic IP address assignment
- Configured TFTP for configuration backup
- Applied passwords on routers and switches for security
- Designed structured IP addressing scheme
- Verified connectivity using ping and routing tables

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
- VLAN
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- DHCP
- TFTP
- Basic Network Security

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of internal vs external routing protocols
- Practical implementation of OSPF and BGP
- Enterprise-level IP planning and segmentation
- Network service configuration (DHCP, TFTP)
- Device-level security implementation

## Project Objective
To design and simulate a real-world enterprise network using both internal and external routing protocols, demonstrating practical CCNA-level networking skills.
