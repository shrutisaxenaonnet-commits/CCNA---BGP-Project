# CCNA---BGP-Project
Enterprise Network Design using BGP in Cisco Packet Tracer
## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world enterprise network connecting multiple departments and branch networks using BGP routing. The network was designed and configured in Cisco Packet Tracer to demonstrate routing, IP management, and basic network security.

## Network Design
The topology includes:
- Multiple routers connected using BGP
- Multilayer switches
- Department-based network segmentation
- WAN connectivity between sites

Departments configured:
- IT
- HR
- Accounts
- Sales

## Key Configurations Performed
- Configured BGP routing between routers
- Implemented VLANs for department segmentation
- Configured Inter-VLAN routing
- Implemented DHCP for automatic IP address assignment
- Configured TFTP for configuration backup and file transfer
- Applied passwords on routers and switches for security
- Designed structured IP addressing scheme
- Verified connectivity using ping and routing tables

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
- VLAN
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- DHCP
- TFTP
- Basic Network Security

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of BGP routing behavior
- Experience in enterprise network planning
- Hands-on VLAN and IP addressing configuration
- Implementation of DHCP and TFTP services
- Basic network device security configuration

## Project Objective
To build and simulate an enterprise-level network and demonstrate practical CCNA-level routing and network management skills.
